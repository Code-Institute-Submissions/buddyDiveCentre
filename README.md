# Buddy Dive Centre

In the project I wanted to create a website where you can order scuba diving equipment with a local Dive company. 
It is the one stop shop for all scuba diving or snorkeling equipment and booking different types of scuba dives or snorkeling.

### Acknowledgements
* I done the Project Boutique Ado  project and didnt really understand alot of it as things didnt work and I was constanly on tutor support 
getting help, So I decided to do the mile-stone project by watching the  videos and lessons to get a better understanding 
* I started here:
https://courses.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FSF_102+Q1_2020/courseware/4201818c00aa4ba3a0dae243725f6e32/d3188bf68530497aa5fba55d07a9d7d7/?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ACodeInstitute%2BFSF_102%2BQ1_2020%2Btype%40sequential%2Bblock%40d3188bf68530497aa5fba55d07a9d7d7*

 And followed the rest of the course videos but changing them to make the website my own and sell what i envisioned it to look like
